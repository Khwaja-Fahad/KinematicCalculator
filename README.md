# KinematicCalculator

The KinematicCalculator repository contains a C program that calculates acceleration using the kinematic equation. The program takes user-defined values for initial velocity, final velocity, and time, and then computes the acceleration of an object based on these parameters. The calculated acceleration is then displayed to the user.
